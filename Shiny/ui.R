Adjust the slider to visualize temperature and emission change over time. Also, a scatter plotâ€™ s listed to show the correlation between these two variables within different economic status.

Countries with different economic levels (devloping, developed, etc) were all still had a high positive correlation and increase between temperature and CO2 emissions per capita. Notably, the Eurasian continent, particularly Russia and China, has witnessed the most substantial temperature increase. Eastern Europe has also emerged as a notable region experiencing gradual warming. Surprisingly, despite being a developed nation with a diverse economy, Canada encountered the most  significant warming among both North and South America.
    
Analyzing the scatter plot leads to the conclusion that countries with lower income (indicative of a poor economic status) are more prone to heightened CO2 emissions and elevated temperatures. This correlation can be attributed to the primary income sources of these nations, where developing countries heavily rely on the manufacturing industry, leading to increased greenhouse gas production and subsequent temperature rise.")

These characteristics include CO2 emissions, population, GDP per capita, total GDP and average temperature, and the time range covers 1990 to 2010. Through these line charts, users can visually compare the changing trends of these characteristics in different countries, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the interrelationship between climate change and economic development."),

Data show that CO2 emissions are on the rise in most countries and are closely related to population growth and economic development. At the same time, per capita GDP and total GDP have also increased significantly in many countries, indicating that economic development has played a certain role in promoting the increase in CO2 emissions. However, some countries have shown better results in controlling CO2 emissions, which may be related to the environmental protection policies and technological innovations they have adopted. In addition, changes in average temperature also reflect the trend of climate change to a certain extent, showing a gradual upward trend, which may have an important impact on human society and the ecological environment.")
