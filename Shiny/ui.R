Countries with different economic levels (devloping, developed, etc) were all still had a high positive correlation and increase between temperature and CO2 emissions per capita. Notably, the Eurasian continent, particularly Russia and China, has witnessed the most substantial temperature increase. Eastern Europe has also emerged as a notable region experiencing gradual warming. Surprisingly, despite being a developed nation with a diverse economy, Canada encountered the most  significant warming among both North and South America.
    
Analyzing the scatter plot leads to the conclusion that countries with lower income (indicative of a poor economic status) are more prone to heightened CO2 emissions and elevated temperatures. This correlation can be attributed to the primary income sources of these nations, where developing countries heavily rely on the manufacturing industry, leading to increased greenhouse gas production and subsequent temperature rise.")

The option box on the left provides multiple options. Users can select different countries and different characteristics to generate corresponding line charts. These characteristics include CO2 emissions, population, GDP per capita, total GDP and average temperature, and the time range covers 1990 to 2010. Through these line charts, users can visually compare the changing trends of these characteristics in different countries, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the interrelationship between climate change and economic development."),

  p("Based on the features selected by the user, the page will generate corresponding line charts. Users can use these charts to explore the relationship between different variables. For example, if the user selects CO2 emissions as a feature, it can be observed that the CO2 emissions of some countries gradually increase over time, which may have a positive correlation with economic growth and industrialization. Additionally, if the user selects population as a feature, the relationship between population growth rate and economic development can be observed. Higher population growth rates may be associated with higher economic growth rates and vice versa.

In terms of correlation between variables, it can be observed that there is a positive correlation between some characteristics, such as population growth rate and GDP growth rate may be positively correlated, because population growth is usually accompanied by an increase in economic activity. On the other hand, CO2 emissions and average temperature may be positively correlated, meaning that an increase in CO2 emissions may lead to an increase in average temperature. But there may also be a negative correlation, for example, there may be a negative correlation between GDP per capita and carbon dioxide emissions, because some developed countries may take more environmental protection measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions while maintaining economic growth. These charts allow users to better understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on the economy and climate.")

For example, we can observe that there is a positive correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and average temperature. As carbon dioxide emissions increase, the average temperature also shows an upward trend. On the contrary, there are a negative relationship between average temperature and grain yield, because as the average temperature increases, crop yields may decrease. There are positive correlation between grain production and the economy, because an increase in grain production may promote economic development, especially for the agricultural economy. By observing the relationship between these variables, we can gain a deeper understanding of the impact of global warming on the world economy and provide an important reference for formulating corresponding policies.
