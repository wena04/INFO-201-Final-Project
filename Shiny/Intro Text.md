#### Introduction

Both climate change and the global economy are both global issues when brought out individually. Thus, we chose to approach the relationship between global climate change and the economy in a more macroscopic view, trying to analyze whether there is a correlation between the two. We will use more generic, summarized data from different sources to present a data-driven narrative of the global climate-economy relationship. This strategy allows us to identify and analyze overarching trends and correlations, offering a more comprehensive overview that underscores the profound yet sometimes subtle ways in which global climate influences the global economy. 

#### Factors to explore: 

- How has global temperature changed over time?
- What is the connection between temperature and economy?
- Which continent experienced the greatest temperature change?
- Which country/continent experienced the greatest economic change?
- How has CO2 emission changed over time? 
- How has economic development changed over time?

#### Other questions worth exploring while analyzing the datasets: 

- What does the trend in temperature suggest about the economic performance in the future?
- What historical events have taken place in this time period that may have influenced climate change and economic development?

#### About the dataset:

All climate-related data were found on Kaggle. The global economy dataset came from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which does world economy and finance surveys. The Datasets can be found from these links: 

[Climage Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) \
[Climate Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/world-bank-climate-change-data?select=historical-data-excel-380-kb-.xls) \

The climate data was put together by Berkeley Earth and Kristen Sissenser with multiple columns and rows of data from sources like Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, NASA, World Health Organization, and some other government organizations. There is also another dataset on climate change that came from the world bank organization. The data contains climate characteristics of different countries and cities all over the world, highlighting climate data sets such as the surface temperature, precipitation, Carbon Emissions, and more. With each row of data having an annual, and sometimes even monthly update on each data entry. Climate data were collected by technicians using mercury thermometers (the early dates) and the data collected later were collected by climate organizations such as Berkeley Earth, NASA, and much more. 

The economic dataset was downloaded directly from the queries that the IMF allowed to access different information about different countries and cities all over the world, again with the span of over 2 decades. It explores a certain locationâ€™s economy in terms of its GDP per capita, population and much more. The dataset has around 193 rows (for the countries and locations) and 25+ columns of data. Information published by the IMF are gathered by analysis toward the evolving situation in each country.

#### Limitation and challenges 

Finding answers to these questions is important since they will ensure scientific accountability, raise awareness in large audiences, maintain documentation of historical data, and hopefully advocate for international collaboration. It is important to consider that these datasets has some limitations, possible bias, and errors. One challenge is that the climate change dataset has a wide time span which some data recorded long ago might not be as convincing compared to those that are recorded more recently, yet this project only correlate data after 1990 which largely helped avoid such issue. We must also admit that errors might occur during the process of recording, and therefore the result might somehow be different from the actual relationship and values.
