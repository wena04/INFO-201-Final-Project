Historical data are in CY, but projections are converted by averaging two FYs (i.e. Avg[FY(t-1/t),FY(t/t+1)]= CY(t)). For example, the projection of 2027 is the average of 2026/27 and 2027/28. National accounts manual used: System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 GDP valuation: Market prices Reporting in calendar year: Yes. Historical calendar year data are calculated by adding up quarterly data from Haver. For example, the calendar year 2018 GDP is the sum of 2018Q1, 2018Q2,2018Q3 and 2018Q4 GDP data. The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December. Prior to 2009, the data are in fiscal year (FY) reporting basis converted to calendar year (CY) by averaging two FYs (e.g. CY2008 is the average of FY2007/08 and FY2008/09). Historical quarterly data are taken from Haver to have a smooth series. Base year: 2016. National Accounts were rebased on a FY basis and this rebasing was then applied to CY historical data.

Starting 2012, staff elaborates its own nominal GDP accounts estimates. Notes: Due to the prevalence of multiple exchange rates and a parallel market, for 2012-2022, staff has computed a generalized unitary exchange rate weighted by the value of imports and exports as well as by the different windows used to acquire foreign exchange.

DANE (Colombia Institute of Statistics) has done a rebasing of the national accounts (now base year is 2015 and before 2005). Data with the new base is ONLY AVAILABLE FROM 2005. The change also includes methodological changes (for example, direct estimation of private consumption based on a survey) and most important, change in the index formulae (historically a Laspeyres fixed-base index and now a Laspeyres chain index). The main implications are that the 2005 and 2015 series are not comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components.

National accounts manual used: System of National Accounts (SNA) 2008 GDP valuation: Market prices Reporting in calendar year: Yes. Historical calendar year data are calculated by adding up quarterly data from Haver. For example, the calendar year 2018 GDP is the sum of 2018Q1, 2018Q2,2018Q3 and 2018Q4 GDP data. The GDP components(consumption, investment, exports and imports) are distributed proportionally based on the average share of two fiscal year GDP data. For example, CY2018 gross capital formation= CY2018 GDP *average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 gross capital formation)/average(FY2017/18+FY 2018/19 GDP). Start/end months of reporting year: January/December. Prior to 2009, the data are in fiscal year (FY) reporting basis converted to calendar year (CY) by averaging two FYs (e.g. CY2008 is the average of FY2007/08 and FY2008/09). Historical quarterly data are taken from Haver to have a smooth series. Base year: 2016. National Accounts were rebased on a FY basis and this rebasing was then applied to CY historical data.

Starting 2012, staff elaborates its own nominal GDP accounts estimates. Notes: Due to the prevalence of multiple exchange rates and a parallel market, for 2012-2022, staff has computed a generalized unitary exchange rate weighted by the value of imports and exports as well as by the different windows used to acquire foreign exchange. Starting in 2012, staff estimates the nominal GDP in local currency using real GDP levels published by the country and deflators calculated by staff. Nominal GDP in U.S. dollars is calculated dividing the local currency GDP by the generalized unitary exchange rate.

Formally, the National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: Belarus purchases crude oil from Russia at a discounted world market price. Due to internal tax changes in Russia, this discount is projected to gradually fall to zero by the end of 2024. Current WEO projections for Belarus are based on information provided by the authorities on a bilateral oil price deal with Russia that is being negotiated, but is not yet formally signed. The dynamics of the imported oil price deflator is set by world prices as well as by the discount, so it does not follow world prices. Deflator of oil exports reflects (i) crude oil and (ii) oil products. Oil products are priced differently from crude oil. The historical values are taken from the authorities' data. Projections should broadly match WEO's numbers in terms of percentage changes. Base year: 2009 Methodology used to derive volumes: Cost index divided by Fisher price index.

Croatia,Volume of imports of goods and services,Percent change,,"Source: National Statistics Office. By the former Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia (CroStat), now the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (CBS, www.dzs.hr). Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher's, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres' and Paasche's formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special - special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports;. This statistics does not include temporary export and import (less than two years) of goods that are returned to the owner in an unaltered state, services, monetary gold, goods used as carriers of customized information including software and software downloaded from the Internet, means of payment which are legal tender and securities, goods supplied free of charge which are not the subject of commercial transactions (advertising material and commercial samples), supplying of Croatian diplomatic missions abroad and foreign diplomatic missions in the Republic of Croatia, and temporary exports and imports for repair.For 2016, transaction imports below 1.8 million Kuna and exports below 0.9 million Kuna are exempted from statistical reports. Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other; Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is increased by the costs incurred from the place of delivery in Croatia to the Croatian border. Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF). The import values are calculated on the basis of the CIF parity. It means that the invoice value is increased by transportation and other costs incurred from the place of delivery abroad to the Croatian border, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is reduced for the costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery in Croatia.

Belize,Unemployment rate,Percent of total labor force,,"Source: National Statistics Office. Labor force statistics are published at a semi annual frequency. Data for 2010 and 2011 are staff estimates because there was no labor force survey conducted those years. For 2020, the authorities published data for the second semester, but not for the first semester because of COVID-19. For 2022, the authorities published data for the second semester, but not for the first semester because they were conducting the census. Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: There is a break in the series in 2020, when the Statistical Institute of Belize tightened the criteria for inclusion in the labor force. The new series could not calculated for previous years, thus the labor force indicators up to 2019 reflect the old methodology, while those from 2020 onwards reflect the new methodology.
